Starting gameplay:
- Basic (initial) storyline: Witch loses something in a forest and commissions the player to go grab it for her.
- At least six decisions are to be made, starting with accepting or denying the witch's request. Wrong option can lead to immediate death/game over for now.

Later goals:
- Ability to save information and/or have accounts
- Transition from text RPG into casual collection game
- Decisions can loop back to each other, routes expand for more freedom
- Achievements

Stretch/if time allows:
- Add NPCs
- Multiple locations
- Collectibles 
- Battle/fighting mechanics
