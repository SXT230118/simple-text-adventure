# Overview
This is a very simple text based game with idle mechanics and resource management, interacted with using the terminal or console. The game's structure is built in a way that makes it easy to expand on later on. For instance, despite the need for player interaction to progress, there's currently no storyline or meaningful exploration (though there could be in the future).

# Inspiration
This project is inspired by popular resource management, custom economy, and mini-game Discord bots, but in text form. Some examples include Mee6 and BoxBot.

# Future Plans
Shops/Locations: Instead of just having options to "work" or "rummage", the player has to actively travel to locations, allowing for the placement of random encounters between interactions.
NPC System: Game interactions would be lengthier, but it would be nice to have NPCs to interact with for each shop. This could also allow for friendships to build, maybe Stardew Valley style?
